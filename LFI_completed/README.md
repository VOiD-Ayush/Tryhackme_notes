Local File Inclusion (LFI) is the vulnerability that is mostly found in web servers. This vulnerability is exploited when a user input contains a certain path to the file which might be present on the server and will be included in the output. This kind of vulnerability can be used to read files containing sensitive and confidential data from the vulnerable system.

The main cause of this type of Vulnerability is improper sanitization of the user's input. Sanitization here means that whatever user input should be checked and it should be made sure that only the expected values are passed and nothing suspicious is given in input. It is a type of Vulnerability commonly found in PHP based websites but isn't restricted to them.
