You've reached the end of the Advent of Cyber, Day 2 -- hopefully you're enjoying yourself so far, and are learning lots! 
This is all from me, so I'm going to take the chance to thank the awesome @Vargnaar for his invaluable design lessons, without which the theming of the past two websites simply would not be the same.

Good luck on your mission (and maybe I'll see y'all again on Christmas Eve)!
